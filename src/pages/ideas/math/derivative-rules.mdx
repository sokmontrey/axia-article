# The tedious way 

In the [introduction to derivative](/ideas/math/derivative), we see the **limit definition of derivative** which is in the following form:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

We already figured out the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$. Let's work on a more general form of this function, $x^n$ (`n` is any real number).

Plug $x^n$ into the formula we get:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^n - x^n}{h}
$$

If you are from [limit](/ideas/math/limit), you know that plug in `h=0` will not work ($\frac{0}{0}$) because `h` is approaching 0, not equal to 0. So we will have to cancel `h` out of the expression somehow.

The term $(x + h)^n$ can be expand using the binomial theorem:
