# The tedious way 

In the [introduction to derivative](/ideas/math/derivative), we see the **limit definition of derivative** which is in the following form:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

We already figured out the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$. Let's work on a more general form of this function, $x^n$ (`n` is any real number).

Plug $x^n$ into the formula we get:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^n - x^n}{h}
$$

If you are from [limit](/ideas/math/limit), you know that plug in `h=0` will not work ($\frac{0}{0}$) because `h` is approaching 0, not equal to 0. So we will have to cancel `h` out of the expression somehow.

The term $(x + h)^n$ can be expand using the [binomial theorem](/ideas/math/binomial-expansion):

$$
\dots \frac{{\color{cyan}\cancel{x^n} + nx^{n-1}h + \dots + h^n } - \cancel{x^n} }{h}
$$

The plus and minus $x^n$ cancel out. The remaining terms have at least one `h`. If we factor out `h` from the numerator, we should get:

$$
\dots \frac{\cancel{h} (nx^{n-1} {\color{cyan}+ \dots})}{\cancel{h}} = \lim_{h \to 0} nx^{n-1} {\color{cyan}+ \dots}
$$

The numerator and denominator `h` cancel out. The light-blue dots (...) term all contain at least one `h`. We do not care about them because $\lim_{h \to 0}$ make them equal to 0.

At what we have left is:

<span class="sd-color text-xl p-2">
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}x^n}{\mathrm{d}x} = n\cdot x^{n-1}
$$
</span>

What we just did is deriving the derivative rule for power function. This rule can solve any function in the form of (or can be turn into) $x^n$.

# Elementary function rules

To save us the trouble, here are derivative rules for some of the most important elementary functions.

1. Power function
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} \; x^n = nx^{n-1}
$$

2. Trig functions
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} \; sin(x) = cos(x)
$$
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} \; cos(x) = -sin(x)
$$

3. Expotential function

> `x` to the power of `n` is different from `n` to the power of `x`. One is the power function and the other is an exponential function respectively. $e^x$ is a special case of the exponential function. Its derivative is itself.
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} \; e^x = e^x
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} a^x = \texttt{Can be derived from } e^x \texttt{(your homework)}
$$

4. Logrithmetic functions 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} \ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}
$$

These rules, along with [combinational rules](#section-3), should be able to find the derivative of many function. They are very useful.

# Quick examples

Before we get to the combination of function rule, let's work on a few examples to see how powerful these rules already are.

Find the derivative of the following functions (with respect to x):

1. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

$\sqrt{x}$ can be written as $x^{1/2}$. And according to the power rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{df}}{\mathrm{d}x} &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot x^{(1/2) - 1} \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \cdot x^{-1/2} \\
& = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}
\end{align*}
$$

2. $g(x) = \frac{1}{x}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x} & = x^{-1} \\
{} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{dg}}{\mathrm{d}x} & = -1\cdot x^{-2} \\
& = - \frac{1}{x^2}
\end{align*}
$$

3. $h(x) = 20$

20 is a constant, _a number without the variable that the derivative is respect to_. Derivative of a constant is 0. Let's derive that. 

We want to make the number 20 to be in the form $x^n$. We can re-write it as $20 \cdot x^0$ (anything to the power of 0 is 1). And according to power rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{dg}}{\mathrm{d}x} & = 20 \cdot 0 \cdot x^{0-1} \\
& = 0
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\end{align*}
$$

# Combination of function rules

## Example
$w(x) = a^x$

This is supposed to be your exercise, so give it a try before you continue. All that we know so far is that the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$ itself. 

From one of the log rule, we know that:

$$
a^{\log_ab} = b
$$

or 

$$
x = b^{\log_nx}
$$

This mean that:

$$
a^x = e^{\ln \; a^x}
$$

We use $a^x$ instead of `x` and $e$ instead of `b`. Now, we are almost there. 

Another log rule:
$$
\log_b{a^n} = n \log_ba
$$

So

$$
e^{\ln \; a^x} = e^{x \; \ln \; a}
$$

$\ln a$ is just a constant
