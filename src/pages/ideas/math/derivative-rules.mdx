# The tedious way 

In the [introduction to derivative](/ideas/math/derivative), we see the **limit definition of derivative** which is in the following form:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

We already figured out the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$. Let's work on a more general form of this function, $x^n$ (`n` is any real number).

Plug $x^n$ into the formula we get:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^n - x^n}{h}
$$

If you are from [limit](/ideas/math/limit), you know that plug in `h=0` will not work ($\frac{0}{0}$) because `h` is approaching 0, not equal to 0. So we will have to cancel `h` out of the expression somehow.

The term $(x + h)^n$ can be expand using the [binomial theorem](/ideas/math/binomial-expansion):

$$
\dots \frac{{\color{cyan}\cancel{x^n} + nx^{n-1}h + \dots + h^n } - \cancel{x^n} }{h}
$$

The plus and minus $x^n$ cancel out. The remaining terms have at least one `h`. If we factor out `h` from the numerator, we should get:

$$
\dots \frac{\cancel{h} (nx^{n-1} {\color{cyan}+ \dots})}{\cancel{h}} = \lim_{h \to 0} nx^{n-1} {\color{cyan}+ \dots}
$$

The numerator and denominator `h` cancel out. The light-blue dots (...) term all contain at least one `h`. We do not care about them because $\lim_{h \to 0}$ make them equal to 0.

At what we have left is:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}x^n}{\mathrm{d}x} = n\cdot x^{n-1}
$$
</span>

What we just did is deriving the derivative rule for power function. This rule can solve any function in the form of (or can be turn into) $x^n$.
