Function is an abstract mathematical object. It takes in _something_ and gives out _something_. This _something_ can be anything, a real number, a [complex number](/ideas/math/complex-number), a [vector](/ideas/math/vector), or even a function itself.

The more familiar form of function are the one that works with numbers. The expression `f(x) = x + 1` declare a function, `f`, that takes in a number, `x`. For any input `x`, it will gives out `x + 1`.
