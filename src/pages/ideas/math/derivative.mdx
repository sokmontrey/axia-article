# Rate of change

Consider the [function](/ideas/math/function) `f(x) = 2x`. Let's plug in some values of `x` and see what we get.

| $x$  | $f(x)$ | 
|:--   | :-:    |
| 1    | 2      | 
| 2    | 4      | 
| 3    | 6      | 
| 4    | 8      | 
| 5    | 10     | 

When `x` go up by 1, the output go up by 2. This is true anywhere on **this specific function**.

Let's describe this change mathematically. Rate of change can be written as change in `f(x)` over change in `x`:

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}
$$

The $\Delta$ symbol is the Greek letter delta, which is usually used to indicate changes. Let's pick two points of x, say `x=2` and `x=5`. The corresponding `f(x)` values are `f(2) = 4` and `f(5) = 10`. The rate of change will be:

$$
{\color{gray} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = } \frac{10 - 4}{5 - 2} = {\textcolor{#40ff8c} 2}
$$

Any other two points will give the same rate of change (as long as they are not the same point). This is because `f(x) = 2x` is a linear function.

# Two points <span class="mono-font">!=</span> One point

Now consider a different function, `f(x) = x^2`. 

![x square](/plots/x_square.png)

Different set of points might give different rate of change. For example:

1. x=1 and x=2

$$
\frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{2^2 - 1^2}{2 - 1} = 3
$$

2. x=1 and x=3

$$
\frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{3^2 - 1^2}{3 - 1} = 4
$$

This formula only works when we want to find the rate of change between **two points**, `x1 to x2` (average rate of change between x1 and x2). But it is inaccurate to find the rate of change at a **specific** point on any given, non-linear, function.

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

For instance, how can I find the the rate of change at **exactly** `x=1`?. The **instantaneous** (exact) rate of change is `2` (check [Closer and Closer](#section-3) section for details). 

In physic, your car speed at `a` could be different from your overall speed from `a` to `b`, especially in a real-life. check [Additional Info](#section-4) for more applications. Our problem is that the formula need two points, but two points changes the meaning of "instantaneous rate of change". So how can we find the rate of change with only one point?

I hope this is enough to convince you that we need a different way to find the rate of change.

# Not too far

We still use a second point for the formula, _but what if it is very close to the first one?_ **Not on top, but very close**. Let's rewrite the formula. Instead of using another point, $x_2$, we take the input, $x$, and add a very small number to it. Call this small number $\Delta x$. Now, here is how we find the rate of change:

$$
\frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

We use $x + \Delta x$ instead of $x_2$. $\Delta x$ need to be a small number, indicating a small change in $x$, bringing the second point closer to the first one. Substract this by $f(x)$ gives us the change in output. The change in input is $\cancel{x} + \Delta x - \cancel{x}$, which is just $\Delta x$.

# Closer and Closer

In Calculus, we can use [limit](/ideas/math/limit) to make $\Delta x$ as close to zero as possible (extremely small). Here is the previous expression with limit:

$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This is essentially the definition of derivative. Derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is (replace $\Delta x$ with $h$):

<span class="sd-color text-xl p-2">
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
</span>

> <span class="title">Note</span>
> You might encounter a different notation for derivative, such as $f'(x)$. They all mean the same thing. But I prefer the Leibniz notation, $\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}$, because it is more intuitive.

Let's use this to find the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$. Plug $x^2$ in the formula we get:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}
$$

Pluging in `h=0` will not do us any good since it make the whole thing $\frac{0}{0}$. We keep `x` and `h` as it is for now. Expand the term $(x + h)^2$ we get $x^2 + 2xh + h^2$ ([binomial expansion](/ideas/math/binomial-expansion)). The numerator becomes:

$$
\cancel{x^2} + 2xh + h^2 \cancel{- x^2} = 2xh + h^2 \\
{} \\
\Rightarrow \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cancel{h}(2x + h)}{\cancel{h}}  \\
$$

We can plug in `h=0` and get $2x$. So the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ with respect to $x$ is:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = 2x
$$

Now, we can use this to find the rate of change at any point on the function $f(x) = x^2$. For example, at $x=1$:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = 2(1) = 2
$$

Remember, `h` is very small, but not zero. This mean that the two points are very close to each other, but not on top of one another.
