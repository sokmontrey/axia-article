# Rate of change

Consider the [function](/ideas/math/function) `f(x) = 2x`. Let's plug in some values of `x` and see what we get.

| $x$  | $f(x)$ | 
|:--   | :-:    |
| 1    | 2      | 
| 2    | 4      | 
| 3    | 6      | 
| 4    | 8      | 
| 5    | 10     | 

When `x` is increase by 1, the output go up by 2. This is true anywhere on this specific function.

Let's us describe this change mathematically. Rate of change can be written as change in `f(x)` over change in `x`:

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}
$$

The $\Delta$ symbol is the Greek letter delta, which is usually used to indicate changes. Let's pick two points of x, say `x=2` and `x=5`. The corresponding `f(x)` values are `f(2) = 4` and `f(5) = 10`. The rate of change will be:

$$
{\color{gray} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = } \frac{10 - 4}{5 - 2} = {\textcolor{#40ff8c} 2}
$$

Any other two points will give the same rate of change (as long as they are not the same point). This is because `f(x) = 2x` is a linear function.

# Two points is not one point

Now consider a different function, `f(x) = x^2`.

Different set of poitns might give different rate of change. For example:

1. x=1 and x=2

$$
\frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{2^2 - 1^2}{2 - 1} = 3
$$

2. x=1 and x=3

$$
\frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{3^2 - 1^2}{3 - 1} = 4
$$

This formula only works when we want to find the rate of change between **two points**, `x1 to x2` (average rate of change between x1 and x2). But it is inaccurate to find the rate of change at a **specific** point on any given, non-linear, function.

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
