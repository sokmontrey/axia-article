# Rate of change

Consider the [function](/ideas/math/function) `f(x) = 2x`. Let's plug in some values of `x` and see what we get.

| $x$  | $f(x)$ | 
|:--   | :-:    |
| 1    | 2      | 
| 2    | 4      | 
| 3    | 6      | 
| 4    | 8      | 
| 5    | 10     | 

When `x` is increase by 1, the output go up by 2. This is true anywhere on this specific function.

Let's describe this change mathematically. Rate of change can be written as change in `f(x)` over change in `x`:

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}
$$

The $\Delta$ symbol is the Greek letter delta, which is usually used to indicate changes. Let's pick two points of x, say `x=2` and `x=5`. The corresponding `f(x)` values are `f(2) = 4` and `f(5) = 10`. The rate of change will be:

$$
{\color{gray} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = } \frac{10 - 4}{5 - 2} = {\textcolor{#40ff8c} 2}
$$

Any other two points will give the same rate of change (as long as they are not the same point). This is because `f(x) = 2x` is a linear function.

Now consider a different function, `f(x) = x^2`.

Different set of points might give different rate of change. For example:

1. x=1 and x=2

$$
\frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{2^2 - 1^2}{2 - 1} = 3
$$

2. x=1 and x=3

$$
\frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{3^2 - 1^2}{3 - 1} = 4
$$

This formula only works when we want to find the rate of change between **two points**, `x1 to x2` (average rate of change between x1 and x2). But it is inaccurate to find the rate of change at a **specific** point on any given, non-linear, function.

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

For instance, if I want to find the the rate of change at exactly **`x=1`**, no more or less. The **instantaneous** rate of change (exact rate of change at x=1) is 2 (check [Deriving rules](#section-4) section). But how will we use the previous formula with only one $x$?

I hope that this is enough to convince you that we need a different way to find the rate of change.

# Not too far

We still use a second point for the formula, _but what if it is is very close to the first one?_. Let's rewrite the formula. Instead of using another point, $x_2$, we take the input, $x$, and add a very small number to it. Call this small number $\Delta x$. Now, here is how we will find the rate of change:

$$
\frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

Just to explain the algebra, we use $x + \Delta x$ instead of $x_2$. $\Delta x$ is some small number, indicating a small change in $x$, bringing second point closer to the first one. Substract this by $f(x)$ gives us the change in output. The change in input is $x + \Delta x - x$, which is just $\Delta x$.

# Closer and Closer

In Calculus, we can use [limit](/ideas/math/limit) to make $\Delta x$ as close to zero as possible (extremely small). Here is the previous expression with limit:

$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This is essentially the definition of derivative. Derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is (replace $\Delta x$ with $h$):

<span class="sd-color text-xl p-2">
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

> You might encounter a different notation for derivative, such as $f'(x)$. They all mean the same thing. But I prefer the Leibniz notation, $\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}$, because it is more intuitive.

Using the definition of derivative every time we solve a problem is not practical.
