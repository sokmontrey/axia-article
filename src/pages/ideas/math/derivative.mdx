Consider the [function](/ideas/math/function) `f(x) = 2x`. Let's plug in some values of `x` and see what we get.

| $x$  | $f(x)$ | 
|:--| :-: |
| 1    | 2      | 
| 2    | 4      | 
| 3    | 6      | 
| 4    | 8      | 
| 5    | 10     | 

Everytime `x` is increase by 1, the output go up by 2. This is true anywhere on this specific function.
