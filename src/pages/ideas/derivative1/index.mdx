import Link from '@/components/Link.astro'

The output of the <Link href="/ideas/function1">Function</Link> `f(x) = 2x` increase by `2` everytime the input `x` is increment by `1`. Here, `2` is the rate of change of `f(x)` with respect to `x`. No matter where we are (any inputs) on the function `f(x)` the rate of change is always `2`.
